Data Analytics Journey

This is my space to track the ups and downs of learning data analytics.  
I’m starting with Excel — one day, one file, one small win at a time.  
Over time, I’ll move into SQL, Python, and whatever else the journey demands.  

Here you’ll find:
- "Daily logs" of what I learned and how much time I put in  
- "Practice files" (Excel, later SQL,Python and etc..)  
- A growing trail of progress, mistakes, and lessons  

It’s not polished or perfect..it’s real.
