Data Analytics Journey

This repo tracks my progress in learning data analytics, starting with Excel.  
I’ve split the work into two main parts so it’s easier to follow:


Repo Structure
1.Daily Learnings : Daily logs, Each day has a file (Example: 'day01.txt', 'day02.txt') with what I learned.  
2.Tasks: Practice files and exercises. Each task has its own file (Example:'task01.xlsx','task02.xlsx').
